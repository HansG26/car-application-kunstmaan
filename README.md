# Car modification application

https://car-app.surge.sh/

 A project I made with:

- HTML
- CSS (postCSS, BEM)
- JavaScript
- Gulp
- NPM
- Webpack

To run the app locally, run the following commands inside the command line (root folder):
- 'gulp watch': development build - found inside 'app' folder
- 'gulp build': production build - found inside 'dist' folder
